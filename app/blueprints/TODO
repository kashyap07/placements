Blueprints and setup files.

 #Note:
 	--Blueprints: To add features or to extend the application. Create blueprints in the blueprints folder to make the application modular. Which can later be registered into the application.
 		Refer the module already present in the blueprints folder

 	--In blueprints, the name of the variable used to save/initalize the blueprint should be same as the module name for easy registration or extention of the application. Checkout setup.py to understand why.
